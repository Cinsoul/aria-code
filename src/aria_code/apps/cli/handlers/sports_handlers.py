"""Sports context prefetch for the chat path.

The market equivalent already lives in handlers/market_handlers.py; this one
was still inline in aria_cli and borrowed from its globals by stream_ollama,
so the fallback path (SDK, daemon) raised NameError on any sports query.

Kept deliberately quiet: a prefetch is an optimisation, and a missing or
failing football client must degrade to "no extra context" rather than break
the turn.
