"""Models Google has retired, and what Aria moves their users to.

Google's Vertex AI lifecycle page retires gemini-2.5-pro, -flash and
-flash-lite on 20 October 2026 (the release notes give 16 October, so plan
for the earlier date); the Gemini API already admits only users who have
used 2.5 before. gemini-2.0-flash and -flash-lite shut down on 1 June 2026,
and every 1.5 model in 2025. A saved config that still names one of them
would fail on every request with an error that does not say why.

So a retired id is replaced when the config is loaded, and the replacement
is written back so it happens once: a stable model, not a short-term one,
so an install that is rarely updated does not break again within months.
The replacements follow Google's recommendations; 2.5 Flash moves to 3.5
Flash rather than a Lite model so the user loses nothing in capability.
