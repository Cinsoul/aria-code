"""The open side must keep working when the quant engine is not installed.

CLOSING_SOURCE.md plans to compile packages/quant_engine and move it to a
private repository, at which point a public checkout will not contain it at all.
That plan rests on one claim -- that every call site degrades rather than
crashing -- and nothing tested the claim, because the engine has always been
present in this tree.

An audit of the eleven import sites outside the package found nine inside
`try/except ImportError` and two that are not:

    agents/sports/football_agent.py            in predict()
    apps/cli/commands/ashare_prediction_cmds.py  in build_prediction_service()

Those two are still safe, but for a different reason: every caller wraps the
call in `except Exception`, which catches ImportError on the way past. That is a
weaker guarantee than guarding the import -- it depends on callers, and a new
caller gets no help from it -- so it is worth having a test that says so rather
than a comment.

The engine is blocked with a meta_path finder in a subprocess, because
sys.modules and sys.meta_path are process-global and this has to look like a
checkout that genuinely lacks the package.
