"""Where the open side ends and the private quant engine begins.

CLOSING_SOURCE.md describes moving packages/quant_engine to a private repository
as future work ("阶段 2 — 拆库"). Reading the tree, most of it has already
happened. Six of the engine's subpackages are not in this repository at all:

    services/        corporate finance, Stripe analytics, A-share prediction
    agent_runtime/   the quant strategist agent
    risk/            the risk-compliance agent
    analysis/        signal pipeline
    strategies/      strategy bases
    mcp_server.py    the engine's own MCP server

The open side still imports them, guarded, and degrades with a message. What
remains in the tree is stochastic/, sports/, backtest/ and portfolio/.

That split is load-bearing and invisible: an import of an already-private module
looks exactly like an import of a present one, and the difference only shows up
at runtime in a public checkout. So this test pins it.

The property that actually matters is the third test below. An *unguarded*
import of an already-private module is not a degradation -- it is a crash in
every public checkout, on a code path that works perfectly on a developer
machine that has the private repository checked out next door.
