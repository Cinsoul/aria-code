"""Packaging constraints that a passing test suite cannot otherwise notice.

requires-python's upper bound is load-bearing: pandas_ta pulls numba, which
hard-refuses to build on 3.14, so without the bound pip starts the install and
dies deep in a numba source build with an error naming neither aria-code nor
pandas_ta. With it, pip refuses up front and says why.

It was added deliberately (1b2ca47) and silently removed by a CI commit about
ruff and pytest paths (4b46f32), leaving seven lines of comment explaining a
constraint the line below no longer expressed. Nothing failed, because no test
installs the package on 3.14.
