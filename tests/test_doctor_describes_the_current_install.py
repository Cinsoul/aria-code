"""doctor must describe the installer that ships, not the one that was deleted.

The npm package was rewritten from a postinstall that built a venv into a
zero-dependency launcher that execs a prebuilt binary, delivered as one
optionalDependency per platform. `npm/scripts/postinstall.js`, `npm/lib/venv.js`
and `npm/lib/paths.js` were deleted; the only script left in package.json is
`test`.

doctor's repair suggestions did not follow:

    "Repair with: node $(npm root -g)/aria-code/scripts/postinstall.js"
    "Run npm repair/update-engine or reinstall dependencies."
    "... bash install.sh --rebuild (repo checkout) or npm run repair (npm install)"

All three name things that no longer exist. A user who hit any of them was
sent to a dead end by the tool whose whole job is telling them what to do.

The new check is the one that matters for the current installer: npm skips an
optionalDependency it cannot resolve *silently* — that is what "optional"
means — so a launcher with no binary behind it reports nothing until the user
runs something. Every npm install to date is in that state, because the five
platform packages have never been published.
