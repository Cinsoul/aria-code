"""The declared license must be the same one in every place that declares it.

Before this test the repository named three different licenses at once. LICENSE
was BSL 1.1, pyproject and both npm manifests said BUSL-1.1, and
CONTRIBUTING.md told contributors their work would be published under MIT --
which had not been true since 4.2.0. A contributor who read CONTRIBUTING.md was
being given the wrong terms, and nothing failed, because no test reads these
files.

The fix is not "check that they all say Apache-2.0". Six files declaring the
same string independently will drift again; that is what happened. LICENSE is
the authority here, because it is the only one of them that is the license
rather than a claim about it, so every other file is checked against it.

The per-version history is deliberately asserted too. A license grant cannot be
withdrawn from someone who already holds it, so the 4.x releases stay BSL and
the pre-4.2 releases stay MIT no matter what this repository says today. Losing
that note from NOTICE would misrepresent what those releases are.
