"""Every turn is told to write the files it is asked for, compute numbers with code,
and keep a client's document to that client's data.

In the Vertex evals the agent reported reorder.json's contents without writing
it, and added up a shipper's stock by hand (500 for 560). Two of those prompts
read as general chat and got the short general prompt, with no tool discipline.
