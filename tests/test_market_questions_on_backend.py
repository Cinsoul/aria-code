"""A market question on the Arthera backend route gets data, not a refusal.

"分析苹果股票" on gemini-3.8-flash via the Arthera API ended with "This
request requires current verified financial data, but no usable tool result
was obtained". Three faults met there:

- That route (AriaSSEProvider) is sent no local tool schemas, yet the turn
  counted as tool-capable, which skipped the local market pre-fetch too — so
  nothing fetched any data, and the evidence gate refused.
- When the pre-fetch did run and the model was asked to comment, the prompt
  said "the data above" while the turn's history (conversation[:-1]) had just
  dropped that data, the last entry.
- The evidence rule took "API" and "CSV" for tickers and missed "分析AAPL",
  "分析一下特斯拉" and "How's NVDA this week?".
